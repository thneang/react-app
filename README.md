This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project

This repository contains the main website and all future React apps using Next.js.
Itâ€™s my playground to develop stuff, experiment, and allow easy deployment with Vercel.

## Content

For now, it includes the portfolio and a Trello-like app available at the /board route.
